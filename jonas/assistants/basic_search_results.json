            "content": "Nvidia initially had no name and the co-founders named all their files NV, as in \"next version\".[26] The need to incorporate the company prompted the co-founders to review all words with those two letters, leading them to \"invidia\", the Latin word for \"envy\".[26] The company's original headquarters office was in Sunnyvale, California.[26]\nNvidia went public on January 22, 1999.[28][29][30]\nReleases and acquisitions[edit]\nThe release of the RIVA TNT in 1998, solidified Nvidia's reputation for developing capable graphics adapters. The agreed upon refund represents the portion of the cost of the storage and performance capabilities the consumers assumed they were obtaining when they purchased the card.[160]\nWhile the Maxwell series was marketed as fully DirectX 12 compliant,[161][162] Oxide Games, developer of Ashes of the Singularity, uncovered that Maxwell-based cards do not perform well when async compute is utilized.[163][164][165][161]\nIt appears that while this core feature is in fact exposed by the driver,[166] Nvidia partially implemented it through a driver-based shim, coming at a high performance cost.[165] Nvidia's offer to acquire Arm from SoftBank in September 2020 failed to materialize following extended regulatory scrutiny, leading to the termination of the deal in February 2022 in what would have been the largest semiconductor acquisition.[18][19]\nHistory[edit]\nNvidia was founded on April 5, 1993,[20][21][22] by Jensen Huang (CEO as of 2023[update]), a Taiwanese-American electrical engineer who was previously the director of CoreWare at LSI Logic and a microprocessor designer at AMD; Chris Malachowsky, an engineer who worked at Sun Microsystems; and Curtis Priem, who was previously a senior staff engineer and graphics chip designer at IBM and Sun Microsystems.[23][24] Getty will use Nvidia's Edify model, which is available on Nvidia's generative AI model library Picasso.[100]\nOn September 26, 2023, Denny's CEO Kelli Valade joined Huang in East San Jose to celebrate the founding of Nvidia at the Denny's on Berryessa Road, where a plaque was installed to mark the relevant corner booth.[101]\nIn October 2023, it was reported that Nvidia had quietly begun designing ARM-based central processing units (CPUs) for Microsoft's Windows operating system with a target to start selling them in 2025.[102]\nFinances[edit]\n In July 2020, it was reported that Nvidia was in talks with SoftBank to buy Arm, a UK-based chip designer, for $32 billion.[82]\nOn September 1, 2020, Nvidia officially announced the GeForce 30 series based on the company's new Ampere microarchitecture.[83][84]\nOn September 13, 2020, it was announced that Nvidia would buy Arm from SoftBank Group for $40 billion, subject to the usual scrutiny, with the latter retaining a 10% share of Nvidia.[85][86][87][88]\n",
