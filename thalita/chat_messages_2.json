If U.S. support for Ukraine remains strong until next summer, Kyiv could have an opportunity to take advantage of Russia’s weaknesses and expected shortfalls in soldiers and tanks, American officials say. U.S. government analysts concluded this summer that Russia was unlikely to make significant gains in Ukraine in the coming months, as its poorly trained forces struggled to break through Ukrainian defenses.\n----------\nRussian Strikes on Ukraine Hit Record High in October: Ukrainian Officials - Newsweek Amid the ongoing war, Russia has launched roughly 2,000 drone strikes on Ukraine in October, a record-high for the year, according to Ukrainian officials.

(WCAX) - If you’re dragging your feet to get an updated COVID-19 shot, experts say the time is now. Kinney Drugs pharmacist Steven Simpson administered countless COVID-19 vaccines this fall. “The variation, you know, can really change how severe COVID-19 is for certain individuals...It’s very important to get vaccinated,” said Simpson. While winter is weeks away, Simpson says it takes a bit for your body to build up full immunity after the vaccine. The state recommends that everyone six months and older get the latest COVID-19 vaccine.

In the book, Woodward reportedly wrote that Trump sent a COVID-19 testing kit to Putin at a point in the pandemic when tests were in short supply -- and that, after Putin received the kit, he told Trump, \"I don't want you to tell anybody because people will get mad at you, not me.\" Trump disputes report that, as president, he secretly sent Putin COVID-19 testing kit originally appeared on abcnews.go.com\n----------\nKnown for espousing conspiracy theories related to health, particularly vaccines, Kennedy appears to be angling for a cabinet role in a possible second Trump Administration, according to NBC News. But perhaps more ominously, the Covid-19 pandemic seems to have brought out vaccine skeptics like Kennedy in full force, not only toward coronavirus vaccines but also traditional childhood immunizations, like those targeting polio, tetanus and measles. Despite the debunking of Wakefield’s allegations, Kennedy became a prominent American figure misinforming the public by continuing to maintain that there’s a link between childhood vaccines and autism. And on Rogan’s shows and elsewhere Kennedy has backed a number of Covid-19 vaccine conspiracy theories. Since running for president and subsequently endorsing Trump, Kennedy has tried to distance himself from the anti-vaccine movement.\n----------\n“Overly optimistic expectations for continued growth in international enrolments, driven by a temporary post-COVID boom, led many UK universities to adjust their future student recruitment targets based on these inflated figures, rather than viewing the surge as a temporary anomaly,” said Vincenzo Raimo, an international higher education consultant and visiting fellow at the University of Reading. Ilieva said most of the remarkable growth in international students enrolled at UK universities, which saw the number of new entrants rise from 273,340 in 2018-19 to 459,170 in 2022-23, was the result of a surge in demand for one-year masters degrees, “as students sought short-term, cost-effective options, after the COVID pandemic”.\n----------\nBiden-Harris administration failed to recoup $200B in fraudulent COVID loans, House committee says | Fox News Fox News Media Fox News Media Fox News FOX News Go Fox News FIRST ON FOX: A new report from the House of Representatives is accusing the Biden administration of failing to recover some $200 billion in fraudulent COVID-19 pandemic loans.
